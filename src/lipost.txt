Building AI-powered applications at Google Developers Group Columbus!



This past Saturday, our team(cc. Kevin Lie) created an AI-powered custom quiz generator.



Studying for a test? What if there is no proper curriculum? Fear no longer, you can now create your own quizzes!



Utilizing Openai's GPT turbo3.5, our application will generate a quiz out of thin air, per the users request. 



One lesson I am taking away is don't forget to look up. Our team was so focused on building the whole time, leaving little time to talk to the other participants. 



Shoutout to the team at Google Developers Group Columbus for hosting the event. Looking forward to building more AI-powered software in the future.
